Inside, you find the miracle worker, a calm, unassuming figure dressed in simple robes. Their eyes glint with intelligence, and their hands glow faintly as they lay them upon a patient, closing a festering wound in seconds. You feel a strange energy in the air, though you cannot place its source.\n\n\n\n'Welcome,' the healer says with a smile. 'I sense your skepticism, but I assure you, my power is real. How may I serve you today?"

If you wish to learn this magic of the flesh, I can teach you... but it is not without sacrifice.'"

  ALT_yearly_events.0020.desc: "While walking through the forest, your eyes catch sight of something strange and grotesque hidden beneath the rubble. It appears to be a book, but instead of leather or parchment, it is bound in writhing flesh. The cover twitches as if alive, and faint veins pulse across its surface. It exudes a strange warmth and almost seems to breathe.\n\n\nIn the center of the cover, a single eye opens, gazing at you, and the pages — made of some unnatural material — whisper with the promise of forbidden knowledge. As you stare at the grotesque book, you feel both disgust and curiosity.\n\nWhatever is inside, it is powerful."

  ALT_yearly_events.0030.desc: "The trickster sits in your dungeons, shackled and bruised after their capture. They were caught red-handed, using sleight of hand and other tricks to cheat nobles out of their gold. It was only a matter of time before they were exposed. As you visit them in the dark cell, you expect defiance or begging for mercy. Instead, they offer you a sly smile, their eyes gleaming with something far more dangerous than mere tricks.\n\n\n'I know you're angry,' they say, leaning closer, despite the chains. 'But what if I told you that my skills go beyond simple card games or sleight of hand? I have mastered a far more powerful art — [ALT_mensomancy|E]. Magic of the mind. I can control thoughts, twist emotions, bend people to my will without them ever knowing. I could teach you this magic... if you let me walk free. A fair trade, don't you think? My freedom... for power.'"
